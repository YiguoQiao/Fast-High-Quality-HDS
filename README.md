**Once executing ParaModelnew.m, users can follow the instructions within, and enter the number to start the corresponding model proposed in the paper. You may also follow the paths listed below to find the corresponding modelsï¼š**

ParaModelnew - EachLayer - PyraUpsampleBasic                            ------                basic HDS model 

ParaModelnew - EachLayer - PyraUpsampleClass                            ------                upgraded C-HDS model 

ParaModelnew - EachLayer_Feature - PyraUpsampleBasic_Feature            ------                F-HDS model

ParaModelnew - EachLayer_Feature - PyraUpsampleClass_Feature            ------                FC-HDS model
